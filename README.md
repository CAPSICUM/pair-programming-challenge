This overview explains Capsifi's coding challenge. If you have any questions while reading, please email your point of contact for clarification.

This task consists of writing a simple **wish list** app from scratch. This challenge will last a maximum of an hour and a half (1.30 hour). You are encouraged to add your own ideas to improve the function and/or style of the application.

The coding challenge requires the following:

- **Angular** framework (v13+).
- **NGRX** for management state - Install the libraries you need from the website [https://ngrx.io](https://ngrx.io/);
- Optionally you can use any Angular component library, for example: **[PrimeNG](http://primefaces.org/primeng/setup)**, **[Google Material](https://material.angular.io/)**, **[Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)**, just to mention a few.

:pushpin: **IMPORTANT:** This is not a UI design test, but a technical challenge. You don't need to use any component libraries and instead can simply display text on the screen and use some buttons.

# **Quick Overview**

If you don't want to read the text below in detail (which we recommend) here is everything you need to know in bullet point form.

- You *must* come to the pair programming challenge with the following:
    - Bring a scaffold **Angular** app checked into a public version control, preference GitHub.
    - We will use this API to get some data:
    [https://www.cheapshark.com/api/1.0/deals?storeID=1&upperPrice=15](https://www.cheapshark.com/api/1.0/deals?storeID=1&upperPrice=15)
    - Use your laptop with the **Angular** scaffolding project ready for coding. We advise you to use your daily code environment.
- Interview is a 1.30 hour test writing a simple **whish list** app.
- You are required to write some tests.

# **Interview Preparation**

1. For the interview we ask you to use your laptop with a coding environment controlled by you using the scaffolded Angular application you have set up. Candidates will be asked to complete the coding test with the configuration they have set up.
2. You will need to login with your GitHub account.
3. Place your coding environment in version control.
4. Email your Capsifi contact with a link to your public repository.
5. We will ask you to share your screen using Zoom.

# **The Challenge**

Most of us like computer games, but there are so many that sometimes we forget which ones we like the most. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could have our own wish list with all the games we love and how much that will cost us. We are pretty sure there is nothing like that on market (cof...cof...) so let's build one!!

:pushpin: **NOTE:** Please don’t do any application coding yet. We want to see how you setup a project, coding will be done during the interview.

The coding test can last up to 1.30 hour and you may not finish all the challenges. If you don’t that’s okay, you will be evaluated based on the grading criteria instead of the project completion.

:loudspeaker: **DISCLAIMER**: If you take longer than 40 minutes on a single task, we may end the test early. As you may not have enough time to finish.

# **Test Criteria**

Please write the following tests to demonstrate code integrity with the least amount of code. Mocks, substitution, and other techniques are completely valid.

- Certify an HTTP call is made.
- Clicking a button triggers intended functionality.
- Verify that game data is printed in the DOM from a returned call.

# **What resources are okay?**

You're allowed to use search engines and tools such as StackOverflow during the coding exercise. The goal here is to demonstrate how you work on a project.

# **What criteria will I be evaluated on?**

Candidates will be evaluated on the following criteria and how they approach it. While you're coding we encourage you to **walk us through your thought process** as it will play a large part in your scoring.

- Initial project setup.
- Usage of Typescript in relation to a production environment.
- API Consumption.
- Finalized code architecture.
- Ability to work with your selected framework and tools.
- Communication with code pair member.
- Quality of written tests
